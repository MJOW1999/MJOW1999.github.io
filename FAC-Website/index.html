		<h3>Coding Background</h3>
		<p>Throughout my university degree I undertook many programming modules, in which, I learnt programming languages such as MATLAB and R. <br>
    From that experience I realised that I had a passion for programming. Taking  this into account, I took part in an extra-curricular project for the Maths department.</p>
		<p>In my final year, I made a mathematical game for prospective first years, in which I had to self-learn C#!</p>
		<p>More recently, I have geared my attention towards web development, learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript through freeCodeCamp.org.<br>
      To see my recent projects see the <i><a href= "#content3">Projects</a></i> section!</p>

		<h1>Why Founders and Coders?</h1>
		<ol>
			<h3>Course content</h3>
			<li><p>Founders and Coders have an extensive 8-week course consisting of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am very familiar with these and enjoy coding with these languages. Adding to this learning the other building blocks of web development I am certain that I would gain important skills from this bootcamp. </p></li>
			<h3>Teamwork</h3>
			<li><p>From the moment I expressed my interest in this programme, I was welcomed with an inclusive Slack community, where I've been able to network and work with my peers. This has been a great experience for me and getting to know and work with more people on the course is a big plus.</p></li>
			<h3>Peer-working</h3>
			<li><p>As demonstrated in my <i><a href= "#content1">coding background</a></i>, much of my experience was gained through self-teaching and teamwork.<br> I have learnt to code through both an instructor and by myself, and I feel that a peer-learning course is the best of both worlds. I can get help from whomever it is I am working with, should I struggle and we can also decide how we learn.</p></li>
			<h3>Becoming Job Ready</h3>
			<li><p>Unlike similar bootcamps, Founders and Coders have external clients, in which students can connect with and gain real-world experience through the final project. This, coupled with learning real world skills like entrepreneurship and user-centered design, gives me confidence that I will be job ready after the course.</p></li>
			<h3>Price</h3>
			<li><p>In these tough times, money is a stumbling block. The fact that the bootcamp is free is another reason I am applying.</p></li>
